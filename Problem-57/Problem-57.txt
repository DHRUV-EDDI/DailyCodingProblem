DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #57
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Google.

Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are 
integers and returns x^y.

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

For example, pow(2, 10) should return 1024.
