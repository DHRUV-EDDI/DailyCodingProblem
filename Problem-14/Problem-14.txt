DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #14
--------------------------
This problem was asked by twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. 
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

Restriction : You should be as efficient with time and space as possible

Sample Input:                                           Sample Output:

record 1                                                3
record 2                                                4
record 3                                                6
get_last 1
record 4
record 5
record 6
record 7
get_last 4
get_last 2
