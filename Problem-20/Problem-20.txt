DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #20
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list.
If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then 
return null.

For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should 
return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].
