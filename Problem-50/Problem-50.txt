DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #50
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) 
data structure with the following methods: 
    => enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and 
    => dequeue, which removes it.

Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
5                                                                           1
ENQUEUE 1                                                                   2
ENQUEUE 2                                                                   -1
