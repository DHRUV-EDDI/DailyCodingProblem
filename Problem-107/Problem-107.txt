DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #107
---------------------------
This problem was asked by Google.

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values 
with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The 
tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
9                                                                           True
