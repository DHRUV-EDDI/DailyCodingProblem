-------------------------
This problem was asked by Serialize.

Given the root of a Binary tree which contains N nodes. Implement following functions :
    -> Serialize(root)   : which serializes the tree into a string s.
    -> Deserialize(s) : which deserializes the string back into the tree.

Sample Input                    Sample Output
5                               Serialization   : ABD..E..C..
A B C D E                       Deserialization : D B E A C

Sample Input                    Sample Output
7                               Serialization   : ABD..E..CF..G..
A B C D E F G                   Deserialization : D B E A F C G
