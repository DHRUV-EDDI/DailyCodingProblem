DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #41
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

    => push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
    => pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. 
       If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
    => max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements
       in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Restriction: Each method should run in constant time.
