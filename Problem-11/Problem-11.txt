DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #10
-------------------------
This problem was asked by twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, Given an string s and set 
of all possible query strings, return all strings in that have s as a prefix.

For Example, Given the query string de and the set of strings
[ dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try  preproceesing the dictionary into a more efficient datastructure to speed 
up queries.
