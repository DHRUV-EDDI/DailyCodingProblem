Given an array of n integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the 
new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. 

Restriction: NOT USING DIVISION OPERATOR.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n)

Sample Input #1:           Sample Output #1:
5                        
1 2 3 4 5                  120 60 40 30 24 

Sample Input #2:           Sample Output #2:
3           
3 2 1                      2 3 6
