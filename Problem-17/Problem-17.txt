A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing 
cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color,
return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

Sample Input 1 :                                               Sample Output:
