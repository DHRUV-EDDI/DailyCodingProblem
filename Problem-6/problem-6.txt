DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #6
-------------------------
This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding 
next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the 
previous node. 
Implement an XOR linked list:
 -> add(element) which adds the element to the end.
 -> get(position) which returns the node at index.

Sample Input:                                   Sample Output:
5                                               Traversing from left to right : 6->4->7->1->3
6 4 7 1 3                                       Traversing from right to left : 3->1->7->4->6
3                                               Element at 3 position : 7

Sample Input:                                   Sample Output:
3                                               Traversing from left to right : 1->2->3
1 2 3                                           Traversing from right to left : 3->2->1
10                                              No element found at position 10.
