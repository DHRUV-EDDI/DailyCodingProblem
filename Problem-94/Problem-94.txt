DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #94
-------------------------
This problem was asked by Alibaba.

Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.

A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then

[a, b] < [c, d]
If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.


Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
4                                                                           2 + 2 = 4 

Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
6                                                                           3 + 3 = 6

Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
146                                                                         7 + 139 = 146
