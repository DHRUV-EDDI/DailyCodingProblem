DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #18
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.
In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Restriction:
Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.


Sample Input 1 :                                               Sample Output:
7
7 8 6 4 2 5 3
4
1 2 5 3

Explanation :
    2 is intersection in two linked lists.
