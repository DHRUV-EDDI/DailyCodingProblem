DAILY CODING PROBLEM - #52
--------------------------
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

    => shorten(url):
             which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
    => restore(short):
             which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, 
             return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

Sample Input:                                                               Sample Output:
